Java Programming:

Java expressions are pieces of code that have a value, and thus a type.

Java statements are "commands" that do not have values.  They do a kind of operation.

	1. A simple Java statement ends with a ;
	2. A compound Java statement is bracketed by { } and contains 0 or more statements (simple or compound).
	
We have seen some statements already:

	1. Variable declaration:    int x;
	2. Variable assignment:     x = 5;
	
	- note that assignment without the ; is an expression with a value.

3. Return statements are used to stop the execution of a method and return a value:

	return 10;
	
The type of the value returned must match (or be narrower than) the return type of the method.

Writing Methods:

Let's put code in the body of a method so that it does something. Here is an example:

	public class MyFirstClass extends Object {
	  public double average(int input1, int input2) {
	    int sum = input1 + input 2;
	    double avg = sum / 2.0;
	    return avg;
	  }
	}
	
A return statement must be included in any method that has a non-void return type.  The return statement gives the output of the method.

Note that we can shorten the code.  One hint is that if, after declaring and assigning a variable, you only use the variable once, then you do not need the variable.  
Instead, replace the variable with the value you assigned it:

The variable sum is only used once in this code so:

	int sum = input1 + input2;
	double avg = sum / 2.0;
	
	can become:
	
	double avg = (input1 + input2) / 2.0;
	
Likewise, the variable avg is only used once.  The method now becomes:

	public double average(int input1, int input2) {
	  return (input1 + input2) / 2.0;
	}
