Module 1: Computer Structure

Computations occur in the Central Processing Unit (CPU), or more specifically in the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) which is located in the CPU.

Wires are used to complete calculations.
    • A wire can transmit 2 different values (on/off)

We assign a type to these two values… A Bit
    • A bit is the smallest unit of information (2 possible values: 0, 1)

We can get more values by combining wires (combining bits).
    • For example, combining two wires provides 4 different outputs
        ◦ wire1/wire2 → (on/on, on/off, off/on, off/off)

The number of values we can represent in this manner is directly correlated to the number of wires in the ALU.
    • For example with 3 wires, the largest number of unique outputs is 8 → (2^3)

A 32-bit machine denotes a machine with 32 wires for each ALU input & output 
    • 32-bit machine = (2^32 values)
    • 64-bit machine = (2^64 values)
